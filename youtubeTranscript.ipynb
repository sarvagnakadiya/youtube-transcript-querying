            "[Document(page_content=\"subscribe the channel and place on the bell icon so that you will not miss any updates welcome back aliens my name is ivan ready let's get started with the practical stuff now now we talk about a programming language doesn't matter which language you're working on maybe C C++ Java or Python you need to do one thing you need to write a code that's important right now when you write the code and how you make it work the answer is very simple actually if you want write a code now you simply need to open an editor when you write a cool and we can use notepad or notepad plus plus all Adam or sublime doesn't matter which one you use let's open notepad here and here you will write a code now I know we don't know how to add a Python code that's completely fine now as we know button can be used in different you know in different areas one of them is scientific calculations now unless the scientific calculation it means you can also add two numbers if you have this huge range of areas where we can use it we can use Python in machine learning in AI in software development or we can use Python just to add two numbers so we can say two plus three I want to know this answer but in notepad you will not get it right of course this is a Python code trust me this works in Python but then two plus three will not work on notepad we need to make it run as we know Python is a interpreted language you need to install a interpreter which is a Python interpreter okay we do we have it let's verify do we have interpreter in Python in Windows by default so if I press the Home icon here if I will search for Python okay I do have a setup here but then this is an installation which I have downloaded before so in your machine you will not be having this ok so that's good we don't have Python okay assuming I'm using your machine so what I will do is I will let's install Python so what I will do is I will open my chrome so we are searching for python download on Google and this is what you got which one to choose example let's say if you don't know how to use if you if you don't know which website you want to go to just go to Google and search for Python download and that's what you get right now we can use other setups as well we don't have to go to actually official website you can go to a finally put it download and the different reasons available but it's best to go for the official website you know what to get to make sure that you the version which you are getting is correct so we'll click here the latest version is 3.7 now you are lucky because this course started in July the version came in June I guess on June 27th this version so yes you are this is the so it is June 27 which you've got this version so we will be using 3.7 here and again when you talk about new versions you will get new features or maybe some old features which I deprecated will be removed that's how it works you know so we go for this version which is download Python 3.7 let's click on this now it will get download in some time so we'll install this yeah so there's one more thing you know we talked about interpreter you will get it so you can run this code so what you are expecting here is we want a Python interpreter which will convert your code into a binary code now there is one more thing you know when you work on real software's of course right when you learn Titan you want to work on real software's in that scenario your project will be complex of course like you will not be adding two numbers you will not be printing hello world and all the stuff you will be doing something big maybe you want to build your own Facebook you want to build a calculator you want to build a child application maybe something big in that scenario you will be using something called ide which stands for so ID stands for integrated development environment what it means is so this is a place where you write your code this is this is where you will run it this is where you can debug it and that's really important you know there should be an option of debugging because in your project of course there will be lot of bugs and you need to debug it so it will help you in different ways so it's better to use IDE when you work on a project so we need two things one is interpreter and second is IDE which IDE we should be referring so that whether there are various ID is available in the market one of my favorite is PI charm it's not that it is the best idea of a label it's just that it is developed by jet planes now JetBrains is you know is one of the best company who works on IDs example for java we have IntelliJ 4 for Python we have PyCharm and it provides you amazing features so we'll be using PyCharm here now is it free that's the question let's try so in fact we have a Python or downloaded here let's click on that let's install python first now you can see when i click on this you will get normal installation options is what you are doing from your childhood right so click on this and I will say yes I want to install Python 3.7 here it will take some time let's wait for it so here we go it's a setup was successful that's great it should work now I will click on close and I guess Python will work now but how do you verify that now the way you can verify that is by going to your windows of course and saying hey I want to use Python now you can see we got a Python zero point seven set up so that we can go with this one or you already get an IDE called as I dl e where you can also add your code right so let me open Python zero point seven here and this is your basically a a place where you can write a code now normally when you talk about you know this is a in Windows if we called in this prompt in Linux we call it as a shell here what I will do is I will write a code just to verify this working because that's very important right so in the notepad we already have a code which is two plus three let's do that same thing so we'll say two plus three I hope it will work I'm saying oh it works can you see that we got five so that's great we got the output but then we also want an IDE we will not writing a code in the IDE in this video but then let's install that IDE as well to type PyCharm and you can see it is it belongs to jetbrains let's click on this one now here the thing it has two versions if you can see well so if I click on download so you can see we have two versions here one is professional version second is community version professional version supports everything you know it's a Python IDE and it also supports web development but that's not the case with community wasn't in community version it will give you an IDE where you can type your Python code and some scientific development but not web development but if you want to use it you need to pay some amount again you can check it out what's the pricing of it here we are to learn about Python let's click on download now this will download the the community version so once you've got this set up just click on that and it will give you this prompt welcome to PyCharm Community Edition setup let's click on next it will ask you for the path you can go for the default one and then click on next now it will give you an option of going forward right a bit launch or switch to four bit launch so I will go 64-bit launcher because the OS which I'm using 64bit you can also have this applications the default setup for some types or some extension you can see we have dot py which is the extension for Python files and then I will click on next nothing specific here click on install and in some time it will get installed so you can see we got this setup done and if I click on run again if we will not be a code here but let's see how it looks like so I would say do not import the setting click on OK and it will ask you for the team ok now some people are big fan of dark themes and some people are big fan of white theme now as a developer yes we do prefer black because it is this your eyes but as a content creator white looks good in YouTube videos you know so I'll take this one and we'll say say next I don't want any of this extra features as of now I will click on start using pycharm let's see how it looks like oh this is awesome this looks good you can click on new project and you can name a project which you want I would say my project click on create ok now every time you open this it will give you this wonderful if tapes but I don't need this I'll click on close and this is where you can write your Python code now again how do we write it how do we get a file that we see later you know in further tutorials but this is how your PyCharm looks like so that you will get an option and all the stuff in fact debug option as well so I hope you're excited for the further cause let me know in the comment section and if you have any problem in the installation let me know or maybe some other members will help you in the comment section so that's it everyone I hope you enjoyed it click on like button there and that's the thing so much for watching everyone bye bye you\",
